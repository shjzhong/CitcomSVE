# CitcomSVE-3.0
A finite element package for modeling terrestrial planetary viscoelastic deformation in response to tidal and surface loads.

Version 3.0 was updated on December 23, 2024 with a new user's manual CitcomSVE3.0_UserGuide.pdf. You will need to download CitcomSVE-3.0.tar.gz, Compare_Cookbook.tar.gz, and ICE6G_1x1.tar.gz. Even if you had an earlier version of 3.0, you still want to use the new files, because input files and certain codes have been changed. 

The version 3.0 was initially uploaded on April 22, 2024. The key upgrade from version 2.1 is the mantle compressibility with version 3.0. You should download CitcomSVE-3.0-main.zip. We are still updating user's manual and examples cookbook, and hopefully we will complete them soon. 

This project is still a work in progress, as always for scientific projects. Users from scientific community may contact Shijie Zhong for more information in using CitcomSVE at shijie.zhong@colorado.edu or Tao Yuan at tao.yuan@colorado.edu.
