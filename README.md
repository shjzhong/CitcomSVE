# CitcomSVE
A finite element package for modeling terrestrial planetary viscoelastic deformation in response to tidal and surface loads.

You can go to two different branches for Version 2.1 and Version 3.0.

Version 3.0 is updated on December  23, 2024 with a completed user manual. Even if you have the earlier version of 3.0, you should download the new version because of the changes to the code, input files, .... The four files to download are: CitcomSVE3.0_UserGuide.pdf,  CitcomSVE-3.0.tar.gz, Compare_Cookbook.tar.gz, and ICE6G_1x1.tar.gz. 

Some of ongoing effort (soon to be released): 1) the code will be uploaded to github as a repository for better version control and development, 2) more discussion on pre- and post-processing, 3) adding periodic tidal loading which exists for CitcomSVE-2.1 to version 3.0. 

Version 2.1 was updated on Oct. 22, 2024 and was originally uploaded to here on July 4, 2022. Version 2.1 is for an incompressible mantle. You may download CitcomSVE2.1_UserGuide.pdf and three zipped files (make sure the new release): CitcomSVE-2.1.tar.gz, ICE6G_1x1.tar.gz, and Compare_Cookbook.tar.gz. These three zipped files are for source code, ICE-6G deglaciation history of the Earth for the last 26 ky [Peltier et al., 2015], and outputs of results of Cookbook example cases, respectively.  

Version 3.0 was first uploaded on April 22, 2024, and it works for both incompressible and compressible mantle. You may download CitcomSVE-3.0-main.zip. We are still in the process to update the user's mannual and example cases, and hopefully it will be done soon.  

This project is still a work in progress, as always for scientific projects. Users from scientific community may contact Shijie Zhong for more information in using CitcomSVE at shijie.zhong@colorado.edu.
