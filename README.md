# CitcomSVE-2.1
A finite element package for modeling terrestrial planetary viscoelastic deformation in response to tidal and surface loads.

The current version 2.1 is uploaded on July 4, 2022. You should download CitcomSVE2.1_UserGuide.pdf and three zipped files: CitcomSVE-2.1.tar.gz, ICE6G_1x1.tar.gz, and Compare_Cookbook.tar.gz. These three zipped files are for source code, ICE-6G deglaciation history of the Earth for the last 26 ky [Peltier et al., 2015], and outputs of results of Cookbook example cases, respectively.  

This project is still a work in progress, as always for scientific projects. Users from scientific community may contact Shijie Zhong for more information in using CitcomSVE at shijie.zhong@colorado.edu.
