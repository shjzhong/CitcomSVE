# CitcomSVE
A finite element package for modeling terrestrial planetary viscoelastic deformation in response to tidal and surface loads.

CitcomSVE is a finite element software package for modeling viscoelastic deformation of a planetary body in response to tidal or surface loads (e.g., glacial). It is intended for scientific community use. It has a global version and a regional versiion. For more about the mathematical formulation, technical details and benchmark tests, users may read Zhong et al., [2021, 2003], Paulson et al. [2005] and A et al., [2013] for the global version, and Zhong and Watts [2013] for the regional version.

CitcomSVE was built from mantle convection package CitcomS which has been publicly available on CIG. There are a lot of similarity in terms of solvers and basical code structure. For CitcomS' details, see Zhong et al. [2000; 2008].

Two files are available with this responsitory for now, CitcomSVE_version1.tar.gz and ICE6G.tar.gz. The second file is for Ice 6G model of deglaciation history of the Earth for the last 26 ky [Peltier et al., 2015]. 

This project is still a work in progress, as always for scientific projects. Users from scientific community may contact Shijie Zhong for more information in using CitcomSVE at shijie.zhong@colorado.edu.
