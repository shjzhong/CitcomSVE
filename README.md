# CitcomSVE-3.0
A finite element package for modeling terrestrial planetary viscoelastic deformation in response to tidal and surface loads.

The current version 3.0 was uploaded on April 22, 2024. The key upgrade from version 2.1 is the mantle compressibility with version 3.0. You should download CitcomSVE-3.0-main.zip. We are still updating user's manual and examples cookbook, and hopefully we will complete them soon. 

This project is still a work in progress, as always for scientific projects. Users from scientific community may contact Shijie Zhong for more information in using CitcomSVE at shijie.zhong@colorado.edu.
