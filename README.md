# CitcomSVE
A finite element package for modeling terrestrial planetary viscoelastic deformation in response to tidal and surface loads.

You can go to two different branches for Version 2.1 and Version 3.0

Version 2.1 was uploaded on July 4, 2022, and it is for an incompressible mantle. You may download CitcomSVE2.1_UserGuide.pdf and three zipped files: CitcomSVE-2.1.tar.gz, ICE6G_1x1.tar.gz, and Compare_Cookbook.tar.gz. These three zipped files are for source code, ICE-6G deglaciation history of the Earth for the last 26 ky [Peltier et al., 2015], and outputs of results of Cookbook example cases, respectively.  

Version 3.0 was uploaded on April 22, 2024, and it works for both incompressible and compressible mantle. You may download CitcomSVE-3.0-main.zip. We are still in the process to update the user's mannual and example cases, and hopefully it will be done in May, 2024.  

This project is still a work in progress, as always for scientific projects. Users from scientific community may contact Shijie Zhong for more information in using CitcomSVE at shijie.zhong@colorado.edu.
